# terraform-google-healthcare

This module handles opinionated Google Cloud Platform Healthcare datasets and stores.

## Usage

Basic usage of this module is as follows:

```hcl
module "healthcare" {
  source  = "terraform-google-modules/healthcare/google"
  version = "~> 0.1"

  project  = "<PROJECT_ID>"
  name     = "example-dataset"
  location = "us-central1"
  dicom_stores = [{
    name = "example-dicom-store"
    iam_members = [
      { role = "roles/healthcare.dicomEditor", member = "user:example@domain.com" }
    ]
  }]
  fhir_stores = [{
    name         = "example-fhir-store"
    version      = "R4"
    notification_config = {
      pubsub_topic = "projects/<PROJECT_ID>/topics/example_topic"
    }
  }]
}
```

Functional examples are included in the
[examples](./examples/) directory.

## Requirements

These sections describe requirements for using this module.

### Software

The following dependencies must be available:

- [Terraform][terraform] v0.12
- [Terraform Provider for GCP][terraform-provider-gcp] plugin v2.0

### Service Account

A service account with the following roles must be used to provision
the resources of this module:

- Healthcare Dataset Admin: `roles/healthcare.datasetAdmin`
- Healthcare DICOM Admin: `roles/healthcare.dicomStoreAdmin`
- Healthcare FHIR Admin: `roles/healthcare.fhirStoreAdmin`
- Healthcare HL7 V2 Admin: `roles/healthcare.hl7V2StoreAdmin`

The [Project Factory module][project-factory-module] and the
[IAM module][iam-module] may be used in combination to provision a
service account with the necessary roles applied.

To allow messages to be published from the Cloud Healthcare API to Pub/Sub,
you must add the `roles/pubsub.publisher` role to your project's [Cloud Healthcare
Service Agent service account](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/how-tos/controlling-access-other-products#the_cloud_healthcare_service_agent).

### APIs

A project with the following APIs enabled must be used to host the
resources of this module:

- Google Cloud Healthcare API: `healthcare.googleapis.com`

To allow messages to be published from the Cloud Healthcare API to Pub/Sub,
the following API also needs to be enabled:
- Google Pub/Sub API: `pubsub.googleapis.com`

The [Project Factory module][project-factory-module] can be used to
provision a project with the necessary APIs enabled.
